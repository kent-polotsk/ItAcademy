*GoodNewsAggregator*
Service collects news from 3 sources, rate them and save to database. 
Basically, everybody sees news that have rating above some default value (as example 6 of 10) and registered users also may write comments to articles. 
There are 3 types of users available: 1 – guest (not a user, not registered), 2 – user (registered and authorized), 3 – admin (superuser). 
1 guest can only read news and comments. 
2 users can read, write, edit (in some time window) and delete own comments; change personal data: name, password. 
3 admins can do the same operations as a user, and also: change default positivity index to show news, set users as admin, edit news(articles), moderate(edit) or delete any comment, ban users (for a while) and delete users.
